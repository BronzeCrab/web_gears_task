## Task 1
Solve with pure js. There is an input on the page with `onclick` that triggers `checkStr()` from `task1.js`. That function testing inputted string, fixing it if necessary and also toggling css classes from `styles.css` to make `p` with id `par` dissappear.
## Task 2
I've used python 2.7. Created class `Node` and `DoublyLinkedList`. Created functions to delete and add nodes. Also created generator funct to iterate trough the list. And created some dummy data for testing. 

It taked me about 10 hours to make this task.
